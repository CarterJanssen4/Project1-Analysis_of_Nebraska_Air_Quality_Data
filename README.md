# Project 1 - Analysis of Nebraska Air Quality Data
### Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze air quality data collected from PurpleAir sensors across Nebraska in order to help the UNMC Water, Climate and Health Group better understand air quality conditions and potential public health concerns. 
More specifically the objectives of this project were to determine whether Nebraska air quality meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards, to identify potential pollution hotspots, and to evaluate how temperature, humidity, elevation, and location affect air quality patterns. 
### Tasks
The PurpleAir data was imported into a Python Jupyter Notebook. For each sensor location, the mean and median values of PM2.5, PM10, and VOC concentrations were computed. Then, maximum pollutant values were determined and the locataion and date of them. Next, it was determined whether or non temperature and pressure efffected these valuse. Lastly, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were compared to to EPA AQI thresholds and sorted by altitude. 
### Results
The Python analysis identified that the five Nebraska sensor locations with the highest average concentrations and highest overall value of air pollution were Broken Bow, Richardson County Courthouse, Tecumseh, O'Neill, and McCook. The results suggest that both humidity and temperature have measurable effects on air quality in Nebraska while sensor altitude does not. They also showed that occasional AQI health risk events do occur in Nebraska.
